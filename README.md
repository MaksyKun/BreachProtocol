### BreachProtocol
BreachProtcol is an API to reconstruct a breach puzzle that is based in Cyberpunk 2077. 
The API allows you to place a breach-window based on JFrame between two transactions 
in Java code in order to have to solve it before the code is executed further. 
This is done using intercepted "BreachEvents", which will be explained again later.

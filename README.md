# Project is W.I.P
This project has no mature reliability yet. The goal of it is to create an open-source fan-made breach-protocol that can
be used in any type of java-applications. Since I lack on some knowledge about git itself, there wont be a maven dependency so far.
However, once everything is working properly, Ill think about doing one.

Feel free to contribute to work together on a completely fictional & hopefully fun project.
